  margin: calc((100px + 20%) / 2); /* Might still be ambiguous - consider simplification */
  /* A clearer, more reliable version if exact behavior is needed */
  margin: calc(50px + 10%);
}

.nested {
  /* Avoid deeply nested calc() if possible */
  width: calc(50% - calc(10px + 5%)); /*Potentially problematic, consider simplification*/
  /* Better - less nested */
  width: calc(50% - 15px); /*Assuming 5% of 100px is ~5px*/

/* Further considerations for calc():
- Older browsers might have limited support for complex `calc()` expressions. 
- Avoid unnecessary complexity to improve browser compatibility and maintainability.  
- Simplify your calculations if possible for better readability and reduced chance of errors.
