The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are issues with operator precedence.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely not because `10` lacks a unit. Another issue might be with complex calculations involving different units and operator priorities. For example, `margin: calc((100px + 20%) / 2);` could lead to unexpected results if the order of operations isn't what you intend, or if the browser doesn't interpret units correctly. Also, nesting `calc()` functions can sometimes create rendering problems depending on browser support.
